          <div class="grey_heading2">Real Ratings</div>
          Poor online reviews  can be devastating to your business. At Pref we recognise that your customers  are more likely to tell you about their positive experience if asked right  away. They&rsquo;re also far less likely to talk about a bad experience online if  they&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to do so before leaving the premises.<br><strong> </strong></p>
      
      <p align="center"><br><div class="green_heading1">Engage your customer</div>
          <div class="grey_heading2">Limit bad online  reviews</div>
          This is why we&rsquo;ve  developed Pref - a digital rating and feedback solution that allows your  customers to provide real feedback at your venue, and Pref Feedback Reports -  an online system for viewing your performance statistics. We can help you stop  the negatives at the door as well as capture the positives to shape your  business. </p>

          <div class="green_heading2">Performance alerts</div>

          <div class="green_heading2">Limit online  negativity</div>
